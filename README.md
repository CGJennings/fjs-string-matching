# FJS string searching algorithm sample code

String search algorithms find occurrences of a pattern string in a text, like the search feature of a text editor. The FJS (Franek-Jennings-Smyth) algorithm is the fastest known string search algorithm under a wide variety of conditions. It combines the linear-time worst case guarantee of the well-known KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm with the fast average-case performance of the BMS (Boyer-Moore-Sunday) algorithm.
